            <p>Landings are getting a little rotted but the overall condition is good. The main bike trail is about 18KM long with a gentle -5% grade. They can be ridden in the winter depending on snow conditions. High elevation trails are clear May-October, bring plenty of water. The main bike trail is about 18KM long with a gentle -5% grade.</p>

            <p>From here the trail narrows and skirts a rocky hillside. Fun transitions and some great little rock drops. The main bike trail is about 18KM long with a gentle -5% grade. They can be ridden in the winter depending on snow conditions. There are actually three trails which make up the loop: Horse Creek-Cattle Creek-Lower Twin Lake.</p>

            <p>Let me begin by recommending you don't do this ride unless you're pretty confident in your fitness. Trail is now covered in snow and you can only ride the packed areas from where sledders and shredders have packed out a trail. One of the best rides in all of tahoe. A long, long, did I mention long? Fire road that circles Mauna Kea. Out here you will find the most legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014.</p>
